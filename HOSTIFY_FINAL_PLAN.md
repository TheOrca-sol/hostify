Excellent! Let's plan this properly before coding. You're describing a full Property Management System rather than just a guest verification tool. This is a much better approach for a rental host platform.
üèóÔ∏è Proposed App Workflow & Architecture
üìã Phase 1: Core Property & Reservation Management
1. Property Management
Host Dashboard: Overview of all properties
Add Property: Name, address, iCal URL, property details
Property Settings: Auto-sync frequency, notification preferences
Multiple Properties: Each host can manage unlimited properties
2. Reservation Auto-Sync System
Best Practice Recommendation: Background Task Queue with Scheduled Jobs
Why not webhooks? iCal feeds don't support webhooks (they're static files)
Solution: Redis + Celery for background tasks
Sync Frequency: Every 1-6 hours (configurable per property)
Manual Sync: "Refresh Now" button for immediate updates
3. Reservation Management
Property-Specific View: See all reservations per property
Reservation Status: Confirmed, Pending, Cancelled, Blocked
Guest Information: Add/edit guest details for each reservation
Auto-Link: Match calendar events to guest records
4. Verification System (Enhanced)
Auto-Generate Links: When reservation is confirmed
Status Tracking: Not Sent, Sent, In Progress, Completed, Expired
Property Context: Verification links include property info
Bulk Actions: Send verification to multiple guests
üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure
Apply to HOSTIFY_FINA...
‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation Strategy
Background Task System
Redis: Message broker for task queue
Celery: Background worker for iCal sync tasks
Scheduler: Periodic tasks for auto-sync
Health Monitoring: Track sync success/failures
API Architecture
Apply to HOSTIFY_FINA...
üì± UI/UX Flow
Dashboard (Main View)
Property Cards: Each showing recent reservations, sync status
Quick Stats: Total properties, active reservations, pending verifications
Notification Center: Sync failures, new reservations, completed verifications
Property Detail Page
Calendar View: Month/week view of reservations
Reservation List: Filterable by status, date range
Sync Settings: Auto-sync frequency, last sync time
Guest Management: Add guest info, send verification links
Reservation Detail Page
Booking Info: Dates, source (Airbnb/etc), property
Guest Section: Contact info, verification status
Actions: Send verification, edit details, add notes
üîÑ Auto-Sync Workflow
Background Task: Runs every X hours per property
Fetch iCal: Download latest calendar data
Compare Changes: Detect new/updated/cancelled reservations
Update Database: Sync changes
Notifications: Alert host of new bookings or cancellations
Auto-Verification: Generate links for new confirmed reservations
üìß Phase 2: Communication System (Future)
Message Templates
Pre-arrival: Welcome + check-in instructions
Day of arrival: Access codes, local tips
During stay: Check if everything's okay
Post-checkout: Thank you + review request
Cleaning notifications: Alert cleaning service
Automation Rules
Trigger-based: Send messages X days before/after events
Conditional: Only if guest verification completed
Multi-language: Support for different guest languages
üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Phases
Phase 1A: Property Management (Week 1)
Add property CRUD operations
Update database models
Create property dashboard UI
Phase 1B: Enhanced Reservations (Week 2)
Property-linked reservations
Improved reservation display
Guest information management
Phase 1C: Background Sync (Week 3)
Redis + Celery setup
Automated iCal synchronization
Sync monitoring and logging
Phase 1D: Verification System (Week 4)
Auto-generation of verification links
Status tracking improvements
Bulk operations
Phase 2: Communication System (Future)
Message templates
Automation rules
Multi-channel notifications
‚ùì Questions for You
Sync Frequency: How often should we check for new reservations? (1 hour, 6 hours, daily?)
Property Limits: Any limit on number of properties per host?
Guest Data: Should guests be shared across properties or property-specific?
Notifications: Email, SMS, or in-app notifications for new reservations?
Multi-platform: Support for multiple booking platforms (Airbnb + Booking.com + VRBO)?
üéØ Benefits of This Approach
Scalable: Handles multiple properties efficiently
Automated: Reduces manual work with auto-sync
Comprehensive: Full guest lifecycle management
Professional: Suitable for serious rental hosts
Future-proof: Easy to add communication features
What do you think of this plan? Should we start with Phase 1A (Property Management), or would you like to modify anything before we begin implementation?
i forgot to tell you that the cause of the guest verification is so we can generate o short rental contract and he can sign it online and the host receive it add this to the plan please
